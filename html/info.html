                <h2>PHOENIX CANARIENSIS</h2>
                <p>Phoenix canariensis (the Canary Island date palm or pineapple palm) is a species of flowering plant
                    in
                    the
                    palm family Arecaceae, native to the Canary Islands off the coast of Morocco. It is a relative of
                    Phoenix
                    dactylifera, the true date palm. It is the natural symbol of the Canary Islands, together with the
                    canary
                    Serinus canaria.[2] Mature P. canariensis are often used in ornamental landscaping and are collected
                    and
                    transplanted to their new planting location. A Canary Island date palm with 10 m (30 ft) of trunk is
                    approximately 60 years of age.</p>

                <h2>PACHIRA AQUATICA</h2>
                <p>Pachira aquatica is a tropical wetland tree in the mallow family Malvaceae, native to Central and
                    South
                    America where it grows in swamps. It is known by its common names Malabar chestnut, French peanut,
                    Guiana
                    chestnut, Provision tree, Saba nut, Monguba (Brazil), Pumpo (Guatemala) and is commercially sold
                    under
                    the
                    names Money tree and Money plant. This tree is sometimes sold with a braided trunk and is commonly
                    grown
                    as
                    a houseplant, although more commonly what is sold as a "Pachira aquatica" houseplant is in fact a
                    similar
                    species, P. glabra.[1]

                    The genus name is derived from a language spoken in Guyana.[2] The species name is Latin for
                    "aquatic".
                    It
                    is classified in the subfamily Bombacoideae of the family Malvaceae. Previously it was assigned to
                    Bombacaceae.[3][4] The name "money tree" is believed to refer to a story of its origin, in which a
                    poor
                    man
                    prayed for money, found this "odd" plant, took it home as an omen, and made money selling plants
                    grown
                    from
                    its seeds.[5]</p>

                <h2>ANANAS</h2>
                <p>The pineapple[2][3] (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most
                    economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.[4] The pineapple is indigenous to South
                    America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple to
                    Europe in
                    the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been
                    commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations.

                    Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a
                    multiple fruit. The plant is normally propagated from the offset produced at the top of the
                    fruit,[2][5]
                    or from a side shoot, and typically mature within a year.[5][6]</p>

                <p>OPUNTIA RUBESCENS is a genus of cactus, named after Italian botanist Michelangelo Console. The genus

                    native to the
                    Caribbean and Florida. It has 10 accepted species.[1] Members of this genus consist of trees up to
                    10 m
                    in
                    height; they are dioecious or subdioecious.[2]</p>
